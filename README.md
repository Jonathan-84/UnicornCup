## Description
What's better than creating a whimsical family competiton. Making it internet official. This simple site (React, CSS, HTML, Chart.js) was created to track and have fun 
with the competition. Our friends have been taking sides, our kids have been taking sides... So are you team Llamaphones or team Hippopposites.

Personal Goals for Project:

This is a web application that can be visited [here](https://jonathan-84.github.io/UnicornCup/). Once you arrive on the site, you will see the "Welcome Page" (you can also access the page
again when you click on the Unicorn Cup Logo). On the Welcome Page you will find general information, including the up-to-date cumulative point totals. CLick the "Cup's History" button
for more of the competition's back story and the Prized Cup. The left panel acts as the navigation controls and provides the points earned by event. When you click on the
event's name, you will see the event description and results within the main (right panel).
