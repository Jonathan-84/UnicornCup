          <a href="https://www.readingrainbow.org/" target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>Reading Rainbow</a></span>, there is no doubt
          about the importance reading and the power of a good story. That said, as many parents know, it's possible to have
          too much of a good thing. Reading is often that good thing. The same stories over and over again, one book after the next.
          Reading becomes a feat of endurance. This event embodies that reading marathon. Each contestant will keep reading until 
          they cannot anymore, reading the same books, in the same order. The contestant that makes it further will win the point.
